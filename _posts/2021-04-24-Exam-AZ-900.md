## Path to the Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

![Journey](/assets/Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.PNG)

I am preparing for this exam to prove knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services, Azure workloads, security and privacy in Azure, as well as Azure pricing and support. Candidates should be familiar with the general technology concepts, including concepts of networking, storage, compute, application support, and application development.

After completing this learning path, i will be able to:

* Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
* Explain cloud concepts such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, and disaster recovery
* Describe core Azure architecture components such as subscriptions, management groups, resources and resource groups
* Summarize geographic distribution concepts such as Azure regions, region pairs, and availability zones

## What is cloud computing?
* Services such as storage, servers and software that are provided over the internet for computing power.

## Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
* Cloud computing allows the rental of compute power and storage from a rented datacenter, where resources are used when needed then returned when not in use.
*       Lower costs
*       Better efficiency
*       Scalability

## Why should I move to the cloud?
* In this ever-changing digital world, provisioning of software and services are released at greater speeds due to the clouds on-deman access such as:

*       Pools of compute, storage, and networking components
*       Services such as speech recognition and other cognitive services that make applications more accessible.
*       Analytic services on software and devices

# What are some cloud computing advantages?
**Reliability**: cloud-based systems can provide prolonged uptime with minimal downtime, depending on the SLA.

**Scalability**: Applications in the cloud can be scaled in two ways, while taking advantage of autoscaling:

*   **Vertically**: Computing capacity can be increased by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
*   **Horizontally**: Computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding more virtual machines to your configuration.

**Elasticity**: Cloud-based applications can be configured to always have the resources they need.

**Agility**: Cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as application requirements change.

**Geo-distribution**: Applications and data can be deployed to regional datacenters around the globe, so customers always have the best performance in their region.

**Disaster recovery**: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, applications can be deployed with the confidence that comes from knowing that the data is safe in the event that disaster should occur.
