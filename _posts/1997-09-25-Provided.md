" They want to be ahead, but continue to fall back, as can ask what is that, its only real and process in their own cycle, some are just for intimidation, others are to learn, still for all that cannot be taught, they are those that are to remain as they are, amongst others are the most learnt, so persue to give this appearence, with no reward, that gets captured in the center character, for now is part of them, did not want to be left behind, yet faded in their own ignorance trying to retaliate, and use it against to not prevail, but remains in the shadows of natural rays".
