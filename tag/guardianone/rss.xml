	     <p>Once strayed and found, but did go too far out, and has just remained what was, what was always. And stand true in what is done, that will continue to succumb, the societies have no effect, for their purpose is of no significance. What is repeated will give up, as others knew where to come, for the correct presentation that would like when returning, that most times is created, and questions ended with true facts, and still have to be far ahead, as each moment is appreciated, and each has its limit, discovering what is around, giving different pleasures to others, that others also once cheerished, and had been shown what was trying to get at. Yes time has been true, and changes have been pursued, as one has kept in mind the proper place in which is placed, and can work towards the height of it, still as one.</p>

	     <p>” Had to take this moment, always letting others have theirs, and gone to the points of always return, not many know, if seen shall not be witnessed again, but will be here, what one has to do is persue their daily work, for its not what it seems to be, others maintain their joints, so with better knowledge when in different situations, its not done for the said, soon accomplished till in the aftermath, with subconscious reminders what had been drifting away, then captured in its own process”.</p>

	     <p>” Examined each time that thought, for all had performed mistakes, not ever to be misled again, checked if was above, measured sequences when quality had confirmed its gift, towards most captivated but was no more just to continue the game, only with benefit it was the approach and what had deserved, came points where got to know the source, figitive methods though beared in mind of occasions contained, little praise or recognition was to be placed of any part, against the positions mentioned, charges defined proper works to suspend, many transformed diversions”.</p>

	     <p>” The least bit of information given, they tried to distroy, plus later contacts, though the path had to be manifested to all, how others responded, with tactics chosen through gradual pressure, strengths made to subdue its cause, as was available, still confrontations surpassed what most respected, outputs contained symbols of definitions, questioned plights cautioned timid approaches, always had to remember their roughened background, toward current positions”.</p>

	     <p>” Had wanted all to go as they wanted, yes those in motivated thoughts to fulfill, it takes its way, what they had needed, came before and still went, now that remembered just lapsed, all could have developed, but rather left with the rest, others tried to change, it was only for a moment, and cannot comprehend, real as it had been, and they try and open to obtain, then continue with their intensions, that some are not even known, yet all seems to be knowledge, and its their purpose, perseverence that experienced, there is no reversal, others expected some to be like that, it was not a proposal”.</p>

	     <p>” And ones laws have to be enforced, not to be brought down with natural works, still was passing forward, not others could understand, many tried to withstand its flow, yet it was there whilst was nothing than to remain firm, see after that time, it changed the whole of others seen, plus it is within not to be removed, but the system has its own way, those who appeared to grasp it only strayed further, though had to remain like that after all”.</p>

	     <p>” As from its purpose still continues, segments provided each time, that they must get accustomed to, all can do shall be left to them, their cycles mean nothing at the end, for its always given, so it reigned just for that while, and all might did nothing to help really, some claimed it wasn’t the job, new cycles came forth with its ways, and a limited version, yet more is sought to be found out, plus go nowhere, for reality is not what is supposed to happen, old ideas are passed on, just to revolve with their intensions, notice the patterns and don’t need to be like that, most took their point which choose, completing it has become hard work”.</p>

	     <p>” Diversions which sustained the effort, the types that survived, with others to be executed, where was praise when most turned wrong, or the friendships paired for distructive modes, how far had all this come to reveal, and the ones misled to accomodate the given time, processions lasted of its own benefit, the world placed choice as had their own values worth, that they created for self, thoug many use at dispense, collected folds soon to relate its past, which was of no concern, then left as prepared, through the distinct patterns recognized by few of older age, even in existence systems manifested their design, plus ones forgot”.</p>

	     <p>” As the soulful death reoccured again, it was just the going of past time, that had not to be recognized, yet filled with various characters, what more than in the association of the opposite, and took its things, not to be repeated, as all truth went forward, now realized the certain ways, many cheerished theirs with departedness, though faded with its own natural instinct, who knew it was being looked upon, plus went further just to remain a memory, and information from an exquisite conversation, amongst all who didn’t know and deepened in its self”.</p>
