## Getting Started

To get started with the Article Management Project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd article-management-project
npm install
```

## Posting an Article

1. Navigate to the `src/articles` directory.
2. Create a new Markdown file for your article. Use the naming convention `article-title.md` (e.g., `my-first-article.md`).
3. Structure your article using Markdown syntax. Hereâ€™s a basic template:

   ```markdown
   # Article Title

   ## Introduction
   Write an introduction here.

   ## Content
   Write the main content of your article here.

   ## Conclusion
   Write a conclusion here.
   ```

4. Save the file. Your article will now be available in the project.

## Organizing Articles by Category

1. To add a new category, open the `src/categories/index.ts` file.
2. Use the `addCategory` method of the `CategoryManager` class to create a new category.
3. Assign articles to categories using the `organizeArticlesByCategory` method.

Example usage:

```typescript
const categoryManager = new CategoryManager();
categoryManager.addCategory('Technology');
categoryManager.organizeArticlesByCategory('Technology', 'my-first-article.md');
```
