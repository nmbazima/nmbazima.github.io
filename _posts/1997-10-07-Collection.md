" Had wanted all to go as they wanted, yes those in motivated thoughts to fulfill, it takes its way, what they had needed, came before and still went, now that remembered just lapsed, all could have developed, but rather left with the rest, others tried to change, it was only for a moment, and cannot comprehend, real as it had been, and they try and open to obtain, then continue with their intensions, that some are not even known, yet all seems to be knowledge, and its their purpose, perseverence that experienced, there is no reversal, others expected some to be like that, it was not a proposal".
