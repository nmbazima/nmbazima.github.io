" How had come back to what was left before, not fully completed, and have to give effort all its strength, that it bears, with striking differentials that existed prior to others occasion, what was supposed spoken, had led many to what they aspire, that underhandedly inspired, soon have much more to acquire, as had to be in awareness to continue in cultivation, limiting so many things as the cycle are with their appearence, having to take those that tried, the difference though seemed as not true, but was to occur with the purpose of things, for they were no strains and could be done with each effective movement seeming not to concentrate on what was to proceed with at the moment, others went and took their plans to work them out, yet should have realized the present to react, others had fallen short soon receiving from those close, to keep the distance, those that later recognized what they had, most now no where to be reached, all remained in solitude of the mind, having continued with varied thoughts, yet must let those of misconception have no great meaning, yes and there was no harm that others searched for, and had to keep the balance in their suspended state".
