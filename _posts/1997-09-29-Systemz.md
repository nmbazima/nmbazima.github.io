" Recall this, yes friend, how notice the difference that the setting sun brings, seen beautified women present that, fragrance put with thoughts of perfection, weighed themself with others that are to be noticed, eyes cast with rust tears burst, what is the waiting for with angers that developed with differed hungers, for something, yet new let old for had to be replaced, and thought of what was before, until finally arrives, what is meant with chosen breath, as those speak out fully sensed, numbers that lead to each defined purpose, for did they have to not concern themself, struggles placed with those of their own circumstance, getting to know truths spent with disguised bills, the world trampled for its mistake of being there, created for anothers purpose to use, yet the planets abuse of those inhabited, many that need not leave, all given notice of time, which would have known as much had once chanced what they seemed of will, most getting caught thinking of dreams that conclude, life split with its own distructive prelude, avoidence peopled by the mass in wave, would have been taken with least persued, strength of its own diffused toward what could have been, distance defined with the effects whirled to no significance, keeping the cause as its essence, yes and continue to wonder whilst the head rested upon the neck, shoulders broad why keep coming back".
