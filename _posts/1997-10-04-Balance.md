" As from its purpose still continues, segments provided each time, that they must get accustomed to, all can do shall be left to them, their cycles mean nothing at the end, for its always given, so it reigned just for that while, and all might did nothing to help really, some claimed it wasn't the job, new cycles came forth with its ways, and a limited version, yet more is sought to be found out, plus go nowhere, for reality is not what is supposed to happen, old ideas are passed on, just to revolve with their intensions, notice the patterns and don't need to be like that, most took their point which choose, completing it has become hard work".
