" Had to take this moment, always letting others have theirs, and gone to the points of always return, not many know, if seen shall not be witnessed again, but will be here, what one has to do is persue their daily work, for its not what it seems to be, others maintain their joints, so with better knowledge when in different situations, its not done for the said, soon accomplished till in the aftermath, with subconscious reminders what had been drifting away, then captured in its own process".
