" When consumed more of worldly products, and others that got offended by thorough events, remained factors which claimed the rest, often profits forgot with untimed activities, wanted actions caused tempered motions, accepted plights of mystic make believe, proposals brought to where motives had failed, continuous payments observed for repossession, limited outputs gave no help to those in need, though soon searched elsewhere, that left not ever to be recalled, went further at its humble expense, some conveyed in captured patterns, but now was to move on".
