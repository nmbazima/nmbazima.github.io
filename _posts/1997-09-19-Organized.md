" We must not be fooled, as nature takes its course, they are the purified substances, natural health has to be maintained, for avoid consuming unnecessary things, there is wastage that is provided, that distorts the patterns of systems, properlly minded and are clean, in the humblest way, all takes its own shape, desires join apart, to form various forces, whilst they work not similar but to sustain".
