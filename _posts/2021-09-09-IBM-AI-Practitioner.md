# Path to the IBM AI Practitioner.

## IBM Design for AI

### Fundamentals

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a mystery and a wonder. It can help us solve humanity’s most difficult problems. AI is also vastly misunderstood by most people. For some, AI is a magical black box with the intelligence of a PhD. It knows all about everything, you just bring your problems and, voilá, your problems are solved. For others, fears of AI uprisings, loss of human control and Terminator-like scenarios cloud their capability to understand the present utility of cognitive computing.

*When we find ourselves in such unfamiliar territory, the best way to begin is by reminding ourselves of the true purpose for any innovation: to improve the quality of human life.*

Consider what we’ve learned living through the past few major technological innovations. The internet brought the world’s information to our beck and call and taught us that whatever we want, whenever we want it is always a finger-length away. Mobile tech enabled humanity to take that information with us at all times. Social computing and messaging changed the foundations of how we communicate with each other and language itself.

### ![AI Design Foundations](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#ai-design-foundations)

When designing for AI, the core intents are always rendered through the following lenses:

#### Purpose
The reason for the user to engage with the system. This will evolve as the user and system grow with each other.

#### Value
The augmented capabilities provided by the system that tangibly improves a user’s life.

#### Trust
The willingness of a user to invest in an emotional bond with the system. This trust is predicated on security of the system’s data, the feeling of human control, and the quality of the results the system provides.

### ![Characteristics of AI](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#characteristics-of-ai)

AI is the simulation of human thought processes in a computerized model. AI involves self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing to *mimic the way the human brain works.*

AI is characterized as having four main qualities:

#### Understands
AI deeply understands its domain. It does this primarily through data – structured and unstructured, text-based or sensory – in context and meaning, at speed and volume.

#### Reasons
AI reasons towards specific goals. It has the ability to form hypotheses by making considered arguments and prioritized recommendations to help humans make better decisions.

#### Learns
AI learns continuously through experience. In ingests and accumulates data and insight from every interaction at all times. It is *trained*, not *programmed*, by experts who enhance, scale and accelerate their expertise. Therefore, these systems get better over time.

#### Interacts
AI interacts naturally with people and systems. The interaction model of an AI is expected to flow unobtrusively while continuously building a sustainable relationship between itself and its users.

### ![Design factors for AI](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#design-factors-for-ai)

When it comes to designing for AI, our focus must be unwavering in providing experiences that put the user above all else.

AI isn’t about data, it’s about insights. Data is the fuel for the car, insights are the destinations. This is what people care about.

*Solutions must primarily address user needs instead of being force-fit to accommodate technical capabilities or requirements.*

If a system has the capability to understand, reason, learn, and interact then it has the basis to form a relationship with a human.

For AI to truly amplify humanity we must have and maintain meaningful relationships between humans and machines.

The more we understand of ourselves, the better we will be able to teach machines how to help our users be better.

### ![Relationship development](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#relationship-development)

By taking a deeper look at the psychology behind relationships, we will probably find Knapp’s Relational Development Model.

![Knapp Model](/assets/Knapps_Model.PNG)

#### Initiating
A collection of first impressions and snap judgements are made. Even if these are inaccurate, they significantly influence if each party wants to continue to the next stage.

#### Experimenting
If there’s a degree of mutual interest, the parties start exploring, looking for commonalities of interests, acquaintances and value.

#### Intensifying
With enough in common, we look for reciprocal sharing by the other person that signals their interest in deepening the relationship.

#### Integrating
AI interacts naturally with people and systems. The AI interaction model is expected to flow unobtrusively while continuously building a sustainable relationship between itself and its users.

#### Bonding
Both parties are fully partnered through trust and mutual appreciation. The relationship is indefinite and only to be broken through a formal notice.

### ![A symbiotic relationship](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#a-symbiotic-relationship)

By establishing tone and personality first, the system will have the means to endear itself to the user.

### ![AI ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#ai-ecosystem)

*Artificial intelligences are probabilistic systems. This means that they are taught instead of being programmed. Since they are being taught, they must have context to be able to utilize their learnings. An AI needs this context to understand its place and provide value.*

![AI Eccsystem](/assets/AI_Ecosystem.png)

#### Human
The person whose needs are ultimately being served

#### Machine
The system and its network of embodiments & connections

#### Context
The holistic view of a complete human experience. Includes emotional, physical, system, and domain knowledge.

#### Business
The business needs and market goals to be served by the system

#### World
The external factors that will both inform and educate the system

### ![AI/human context model](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/fundamentals/#aihuman-context-model)

![AI-Human Context Model](/assets/AI-Human.png)

#### Intent
The goals, wants, needs, and values of users and businesses. Intent provides your solution’s purpose.

#### Data and policy
All of the significant raw data a machine can collect from the user and the world and the policies that protect it.

#### Understanding
The process of putting incoming structured and unstructured data in context of your domain. Also known as machine learning.

#### Reasoning
The system’s application of logic to decide on the best course(s) of action.

#### Knowledge
This is what the system knows. This is all past data, insights, and learned attributes measured up against the overall intent of the system.

#### Expression
How the system delivers its response based on the content of the message and its understanding of the user.

#### User reaction
This is the user’s genuine reaction to the system’s expression. Based on the quality of the system’s response.

#### Learning
The user is continually teaching the system to improve through direct and indirect responses.

#### Outcome
The consequences of an actualized system used in the real world to solve real users’ real problems.

### Team essentials

### ![Apply design thinking to artificial intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/team-essentials#apply-design-thinking-to-artificial-intelligence.)

Teams need a diverse set of minds and skill sets to create something useful, intuitive, and responsible. Our course will give you the language, knowledge, and actionable methods to work alongside technical and non-technical members of your team to create AI solutions.

![AI Essentials Framework](https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/team-essentials#ai-essentials-framework)

The framework is a set of activities, tools, and principles that enable teams to design thoughtful, human-centered artificial intelligence solutions using Enterprise Design Thinking.

The AI Essentials Framework is a specific grouping of activities to work through to align your team on strategy for an AI experience. There are five focal areas in the framework:

- Intent: Align on the business and user intent(s) for your solution.
- Data: Document the data you could use to make your idea a reality.
- Understanding: Determine what you will need to teach your AI.
- Reasoning: Bring your ideas down to earth.
- Knowledge: Brainstorm the direct and indirect effects of your AI.

In this lesson, we will learn the AI Essentials Framework from experts, see an example in practice, and gather the resources you need to practice on your own project.
