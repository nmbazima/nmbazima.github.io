" As what is learnt by others, is new from the original, different minds elaborate on the subject, and it is not one to compare with another, they create their own idea from where it was found, these are in their way, each travel has its parts, that reveal the difference in it, there is no limit in which to be the same, while try what can be done, yet all clarity is set before, the establishment has to survive, most partake to theirself for the better, we must continue with our purpose, what we have are the standards that represent us, many will copy, though would claim to have originated, true in nature".
