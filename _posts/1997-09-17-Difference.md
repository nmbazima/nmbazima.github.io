" We must take to mend, the position was correct, what could would happen, but the natural situation was going fast, each time have to witness, or forever not come upon it again, not once repeated, it does its part, rays changed the natural landscape, and should not forget this, each time formed new types, thats natures process, as gives off its shared output, those that treasure it, had to make changes, for the same becomes copied, and it is dark, as all of its journey complete, but in one place, and findings which are realistic, which can be cheerished".
