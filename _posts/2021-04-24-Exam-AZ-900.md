## Path to the Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

![Journey](/assets/Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.PNG)

I am preparing for this exam to prove knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services, Azure workloads, security and privacy in Azure, as well as Azure pricing and support. Candidates should be familiar with the general technology concepts, including concepts of networking, storage, compute, application support, and application development.

After completing this learning path, i will be able to:

* Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
* Explain cloud concepts such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, and disaster recovery
* Describe core Azure architecture components such as subscriptions, management groups, resources and resource groups
* Summarize geographic distribution concepts such as Azure regions, region pairs, and availability zones

## What is cloud computing?
* Services such as storage, servers and software that are provided over the internet for computing power.

## Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
* Cloud computing allows the rental of compute power and storage from a rented datacenter, where resources are used when needed then returned when not in use.
*       Lower costs
*       Better efficiency
*       Scalability

## Why should I move to the cloud?
* In this ever-changing digital world, provisioning of software and services are released at greater speeds due to the clouds on-deman access such as:

*       Pools of compute, storage, and networking components
*       Services such as speech recognition and other cognitive services that make applications more accessible.
*       Analytic services on software and devices

# What are some cloud computing advantages?
**Reliability**: cloud-based systems can provide prolonged uptime with minimal downtime, depending on the SLA.

**Scalability**: Applications in the cloud can be scaled in two ways, while taking advantage of autoscaling:

*   **Vertically**: Computing capacity can be increased by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
*   **Horizontally**: Computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding more virtual machines to your configuration.

**Elasticity**: Cloud-based applications can be configured to always have the resources they need.

**Agility**: Cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as application requirements change.

**Geo-distribution**: Applications and data can be deployed to regional datacenters around the globe, so customers always ha ve the best performance in their region.

**Disaster recovery**: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, applications can be deployed with the confidence that comes from knowing that the data is safe in the event that disaster should occur.

## What is Azure
*Azure is a set of cloud services that help an individual, or organization meet their current or future business needs or challenges such as building, managing or deploy applications using the continually expanding tools and frameworks of services.*

### What does Azure Offer
Some of the benefits that Azure provide are as follows:

**Future Ready**: continuous innovation from Microsoft supports organizations and individuals development needs today and for the future.

**Building on Own terms**: With opensource and support for all languages and frameworks, one can make a selection of tools to use and deploy where one might want.

**Seemless hybrid operations**: Azure allows integration and management of environments on-premises, at the edge or in the cloud with tools and services designed for hybrid cloud solutions.

**Cloud Security**: Azure provides security backed by teams of experts and proactive compliance.

### What can I do with Azure

*Azure provides more than 100 services that enable running existing applications on virtual machines, exploring software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality. With dynamic storage solutions, to grow or shrink to accomodate massive amounts of data, allowing solutions that would be difficult to implement.*

### What is the Azure portal?

*It is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative command-line tools. This allows a tenant or user to manage subscriptions using a GUI for example*:

* Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
* Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
* Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

The Portal is designed for resiliance and continous availability, it is available on every datacenter and this avoids downtime and failures or network slowdowns as it receives continous updates, with no need for downtime during maintenance activities.

### What is Azure Marketplace?
*Users are able to connect with Microsoft partners, independant vendors and startups that offer solutions and services which are suited for Azure through the marketplace.*
