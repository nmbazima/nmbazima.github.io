" Yes returning to old ways, that help the new adopt much faster, all that is to be or was, is not for pure excitement, but for improvement, recalling first practices, methods came in pattern naturally, but now in different areas, with all its own features, what else is there for it, these in all its centered revival, and what has to, is not for others benefit, many will stroll with their hopes, and starve at their opportunity, but what is taking place is this reality, yes progress willed in the mighty, all distance in its own created vastness".
