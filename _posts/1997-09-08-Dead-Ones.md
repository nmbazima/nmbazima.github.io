"Those that supported who was dead, for they knew the weaknesses, soon tidings spoken to comprehend if all explained, the measures distant through narrow defences, how many gave their part to implement though disturbed, times given to plan, what was next remained, thorough knowledges which could not compare yet knew the cause, plus those that left, normal passages of its cycle, and slim retreats, most perceived its path, begotten trends not ever to be said, brought almost back to thoughts, although would not think of those past, strains came between friends, and others caught in death when unaware, each had to experience their mortal end, yes there was time to separate".
