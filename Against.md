It is well to return back to form, into the true state, for not only was its aim unknown, many had gone with themselves in mind, and just live, amongst those around, all energies are recycled, in their own power, although taking this point, it is known that there are other things to be done, yet must fit in the time thats given upon, the few the more movements traced, it must pass for its just the cause of the day gone way, the full extent is the end, plus shows what was instore, as they were before, thats what it had all summed up to, most had no clues, but would have liked to ask waiting for the summit
